## 📝 Overview  
This repository is dedicated to **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems in Java**, providing multiple approaches from beginner to advanced levels. It complements the [DSA in Java](https://github.com/solocoder9/DSA-in-Java) repo which contains detailed notes and concept implementations.  

**Highlights:**  
- Covers all major DSA topics: Arrays, Strings, Recursion, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashing, and more.  
- Multiple approaches per problem: brute-force, optimized, and optimal solutions.  
- Organized folder structure following the DSA roadmap.  
- Ideal for learners preparing for interviews, coding competitions, and personal growth.
